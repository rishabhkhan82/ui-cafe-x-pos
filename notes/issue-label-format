1️⃣ Labels You Already Have (Keep Them As-Is ✅)

These are standard & correct — do NOT delete them.

Label	Purpose
bug	Something isn't working
documentation	Docs-related changes
duplicate	Already exists
enhancement	New feature or request
good first issue	Beginner-friendly
help wanted	Needs extra attention
invalid	Not valid
question	Clarification needed
wontfix	Will not be worked on

🟢 These handle triage & community flow

2️⃣ Labels You Should ADD (Compared to My Suggested List)
🔹 A. Component / Area Labels (VERY IMPORTANT)

👉 These are missing completely right now.

Label Name	Description	Hex Color
api	Backend APIs & business logic	#1F6FEB

multi-tenant	Tenant isolation, org logic	#2EA44F

🟢 These labels answer “WHERE is the issue?”

🔹 B. Priority Labels (Execution clarity)
Label Name	Description	Hex Color
priority:critical	Production blocker	#B60205
priority:high	Must be fixed soon	#D93F0B
priority:medium	Normal priority	#FBCA04
priority:low	Can wait	#0E8A16

🟢 These help in planning, sprinting & escalation

🔹 C. Workflow / Status Labels (Tracking)

3️⃣ Final Count After Adding

Existing: 9

New recommended: 20

Total = 29 labels

👉 This is perfectly healthy for a professional SaaS / POS system.

4️⃣ Minimum Add-First Set (If You Want to Go Step-by-Step)

If you don’t want to add all at once, start with these 10 👇

api
ui
db
inventory
billing
priority:high
priority:medium
status:in-progress
status:uat
status:prod

5️⃣ How to Use Labels (Golden Rule)

Each issue should have:

✅ 1 type → bug / enhancement

✅ 1 area → api / ui / db

✅ 1 priority

✅ 0–1 status

Example:

bug + api + inventory + priority:high + status:uat
