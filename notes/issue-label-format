✅ GitHub Label Categorization (Final & Clean)
🟦 Category 1: Issue Type / Nature

👉 WHAT kind of issue is this?
✔️ Exactly ONE label from this category per issue

(These are mostly your existing labels)

Label
bug
enhancement
documentation
question
duplicate
invalid
wontfix
good first issue
help wanted

📌 Purpose:

Classifies the nature of the issue

Helps triage & contribution flow

🟦 Category 2: Component / Area

👉 WHERE in the system is the issue?
✔️ ONE (max TWO) per issue

Label
api
ui
db
auth
inventory
billing
reports
notifications
integration
multi-tenant

📌 Purpose:

Helps developers & testers instantly know which module is impacted

Useful for filtering & ownership

🟦 Category 3: Priority

👉 HOW urgent is this issue?
✔️ Exactly ONE per issue

Label
priority:critical
priority:high
priority:medium
priority:low

📌 Purpose:

Sprint planning

Escalation

Production readiness

🟦 Category 4: Workflow / Status

👉 WHAT is the current state of the issue?
✔️ Optional (0 or 1 at a time)

Label
status:in-progress
status:blocked
status:review
status:uat
status:prod
status:needs-info

📌 Purpose:

Tracks issue lifecycle

Enables GitHub to act as testing + release tracker

🧩 How All 4 Categories Work Together (Example)
Example Issue:

“GRN CSV upload allows blank sale remark”

Labels applied:

bug                     → Issue Type
api + inventory         → Component
priority:high           → Priority
status:uat              → Workflow


✅ Anyone can understand the issue in 5 seconds

🟢 Golden Rule (VERY IMPORTANT)

Each issue should have:

✅ 1 Issue Type

✅ 1 Component

✅ 1 Priority

⭕ 0–1 Status

❌ Never apply two labels from the same category
❌ Never skip Type or Priority

🏁 Final Result

With this structure:

GitHub becomes Code Management + Testing Tool

Testers & developers work together

No external tracking needed

Clean dashboards & filters
