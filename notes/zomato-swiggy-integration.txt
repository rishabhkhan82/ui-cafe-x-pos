Zomato and swiggy integration in pos (real life scenarion)

1] it works throught api'
2] as the order confirm by user (zomato/swiggy backend send the order data in a structured format (usually JSON) to the restaurant's POS system via a pre-configured API endpoint or webhook URL, This happens in real-time)

Here is the step-by-step process of how this typically works:
The Real-Life POS Integration Process
1. Customer Places an Order
A customer uses the Swiggy or Zomato app/website to browse a restaurant's menu and places an order. The order details (items, price, delivery address, special instructions, payment status) are captured by the delivery platform's system. 
2. Data Transfer (API/Webhook Communication)
The moment the order is confirmed, the delivery platform's backend system sends this order data in a structured format (usually JSON) to the restaurant's POS system via a pre-configured API endpoint or webhook URL. This happens in real-time. 
3. Order Receipt and Processing in the POS
Your POS system, which is constantly "listening" for incoming data at that specific URL, receives the data payload.
The POS validates the data and automatically logs the new order in its system, just like a local, walk-in order.
It checks inventory levels and deducts the ordered items from the stock in real-time.
It generates an invoice and records the sale details in the restaurant's unified sales reports. 
4. Kitchen Notification and Preparation
The order is immediately routed to the Kitchen Display System (KDS) or a kitchen printer. 
Kitchen staff see the order details, including preparation times and special notes, on one screen, alongside any other orders (dine-in, local delivery).
Staff can manage the order status directly from this interface (e.g., mark as "preparing", "ready for pickup"). 
5. Status Synchronization (API/Webhook Communication)
As the order status is updated in the POS (e.g., the chef marks it as "ready for pickup"), the POS system automatically uses another API call to send this status update back to Swiggy or Zomato's system. This keeps all systems in sync. 
6. Delivery Assignment and Tracking
The delivery platform, upon receiving the "ready for pickup" status, assigns a delivery partner. Once the partner picks up the food, the status is updated to "picked up," and the customer receives real-time tracking information on their app. 
7. Order Completion and Analytics
Once the order is delivered and completed, all relevant data (sales, time metrics, etc.) is available in a single POS dashboard for unified reporting and analytics. This allows management to track performance across all channels in one place. 

Key Technical Components
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): These are the defined rules and communication points that allow your POS software and the delivery platforms' software to "talk" to each other.
Webhooks: These are automated messages sent from the delivery platform to your POS when a specific event occurs (e.g., a new order is placed, an order is canceled).
Cloud-based System: This is essential, as the integration relies on a stable internet connection and real-time data exchange between remote servers.
Data Mapping: Before going live, data fields (menu items, prices, modifiers, etc.) are carefully mapped between your POS and the delivery platforms' systems to ensure accuracy. 
This entire automated process drastically reduces manual work, minimizes errors, and streamlines operations, creating a unified order management system. 

---------------------------

That is an excellent question that clarifies the business relationship. The integration is built at the POS System level, not the individual restaurant level.
Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works once you, the developer, have built the integration:
1. Integration is done once, by you (the Developer)
You, as the POS developer, build one connection to Swiggy’s API and one connection to Zomato’s API. You become a certified "POS Partner" for both platforms.
2. The Restaurant Onboarding Process (Once your integration is ready)
When a restaurant that uses your POS system wants to integrate their online orders, the process you described is exactly right, but with one critical step: verification.
Here’s what happens in simple terms:
A. The Restaurant Enters Credentials (Your UI)
In your POS system's admin panel, the restaurant manager goes to an "Online Integrations" section. They enter their specific Zomato and Swiggy restaurant IDs, usernames, and any secret keys provided to them by the platforms.
B. Your POS Validates Credentials (Instant Check)
Your backend (Java) immediately uses those credentials to make an API call to Swiggy/Zomato to confirm they are valid and active accounts. If the credentials are wrong, your system immediately flags an error.
C. Verification & Configuration by Swiggy/Zomato (Crucial Step - Not Instant)
This is the part that does not happen immediately just by clicking "save":
You must notify Swiggy and Zomato: Your POS system (or you, the partner manager) needs to formally tell Swiggy/Zomato's support team, "Restaurant XYZ wants to activate their integration with my POS."
Platform Configuration: Swiggy and Zomato's internal teams then manually configure the restaurant's account on their end to switch their order routing from "tablet/manual mode" to "API mode" (meaning all orders should now be sent to your system's webhook URL).
Menu Mapping (Setup Time): You also need time to map their menu items between your POS and their platforms to ensure correct pricing and item IDs match up.
D. Go Live (Requires Approval)
Only after Swiggy/Zomato confirm they have configured everything on their end does the integration go live. This verification and mapping process usually takes 24-48 hours, or sometimes up to a week, depending on how efficient the support teams are.
Summary
Is the integration on a per-restaurant basis? The activation and configuration are per restaurant, but the code is in your main POS software.
Does it start immediately? No. It requires human verification and configuration from Swiggy and Zomato's support teams after the restaurant enters their details into your system. You have to work with them as the certified POS partner to get each new restaurant live.

Zomato/Swiggy POS - summary how to integrate the zomato/swiggy  

Summary of Zomato/Swiggy POS Integration for Developers
Phase 1: Partnership and Setup
Register as a POS Partner: Contact Zomato and Swiggy's B2B/developer teams to apply to become a certified POS vendor partner.
Sign Agreements: Execute necessary legal documents, including NDAs and partnership agreements.
Obtain API Access: Receive API credentials (keys, secrets) and detailed technical documentation.
Access Sandbox Environment: Gain access to the testing environments to build and test your integration without affecting live orders.
Define Endpoints: Provide public, stable webhook URLs from your Java backend where Swiggy and Zomato will send real-time new order data.
Phase 2: Technical Development and Implementation
Receive Orders (Webhooks): Develop the Java backend logic to listen for, receive, and parse the JSON data payload for new orders sent to your specified webhook URLs.
Acknowledge Orders (API Calls): Implement API calls from your POS back to the platforms to confirm successful receipt and acceptance of the order.
Manage Status Updates (API Calls): Implement API calls to send real-time status updates back to Swiggy/Zomato (e.g., "preparing", "ready for pickup").
Synchronize Menus (API Calls): Develop functionality to pull the restaurant's menu from the platforms or push menu/item availability updates to them, ensuring inventory sync.
Build the UI (Angular): Design the frontend interface in Angular for restaurant staff to manage incoming orders from a single screen.
Phase 3: Testing, Certification, and Go-Live
Rigorously Test: Use the sandbox environment to test all possible scenarios (order, cancel, item out of stock, network errors).
Get Certified: Pass the platforms' certification process, demonstrating that your integration is robust and reliable.
Develop Onboarding Flow: Create an internal process within your POS for restaurants to securely input their specific platform credentials.
Coordinate Activation: Work with Zomato/Swiggy's support teams for each individual restaurant activation. This requires manual configuration on their end to switch order routing to your API endpoints.
Provide Support: Establish a support system to handle ongoing maintenance, menu mapping issues, and restaurant queries.
